/**
Build System:

Rules are made up of target files and actions.

The "target files" are generated by the corresponding actions.
When the actions are executed, it is expected to generate the target
files

How to know whether a rule needs to be executed?

1. If any target files do not exist, then execute it.
2. Otherwise, each rule will have a set of dependency files. This list
   will have been generated when the action is executed.  If any dependency
   file is newer than any target file, then the action is executed.

How to find dependency files.

When checking the rule, actions to execute are used to lookup in a database what
the dependency files are.  This could be done by hashing the actions and then
using that as a filename to a list of files.
